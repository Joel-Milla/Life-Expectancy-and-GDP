# Life Expectancy and GDP Project

This project is part of a data science course focused on using techniques to analyze and make inferences from data. The purpose of this project is to clean and visualize data to find a connection between life expectancy and the GDP of six countries.

## Features

- Cleans the data to ensure reliability.
- Utilizes data visualization techniques to explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
- Applies the Pearson correlation test to determine if there is any correlation between life expectancy and GDP in the six countries.

## Setup and installation
You can see the Jupyter Notebook [here](StreetEasy%20Model.ipynb) or can install it locally using the next steps:

**Prerequisite**: This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can find installation instructions at the [documentation](https://jupyter.org).

To set up and show the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Joel-Milla/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the .ipynb files.
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
